            "description": "Although the discussion of Human Trafficking is in no way regarded as a comfortable topic in any given setting, the formerly apathetic response and failure to address Human Trafficking that takes place domestically became the catalyst for Founder, Natasha Nascimento; to tackle what has evolved into a modern version of slavery head-on. With research estimating that up to 300,000 American children were at risk each year to be trafficked within the borders of the United States alone, an urgent and local need to develop advocacy on behalf of children without a voice presented itself.The launch of the foundation, Redefining Refuge in 2010, has since sparked a contagious willingness from participants around the world who contribute to confronting and ultimately preventing Human Trafficking. The goal of opening a local Safe House for trafficked youth was realized in early 2013 and is the first licensed home of its kind in the Tampa Bay and surrounding areas that continue to provide a therapeutic safe haven for girls ages 12 -17 that are rescued from this depravity.Since its inception, Redefining Refuge has been featured on a WEDU Documentary highlighting the organizations advocacy efforts as well as the prevalence of Sex Trafficking in Tampa Bay (www.wedu.org/humantrafficking). We have since been invited to the State\u2019s Capitol to present both the challenges and successes of providing Safe Housing to Minor Victims of Sex Trafficking to The Florida House of Representatives Healthy Families Subcommittee as well as the Florida Stands Against Human Trafficking Legislative Caucus; and were featured as a Resource Provider during the 2013 Statewide Human Trafficking Summit at the University of South Florida. More recently we were invited to Washington, DC to represent the State of Florida during the Shared Hope International JuST Response Congressional Briefing: Mapping State Responses to Sex Trafficked Youth."

The goal is to hire students to fill internships and/or full-time positions.The mixer focus is networking, company representatives introducing themselves, sharing what they and their company do, what type of internships and/or jobs they have open, how many positions they have, what they are looking for in an intern and if they have any requirements (US Person). Sometimes resume or professional advice and industry organizations (ASME, SME, etc.) is shared with students. Students dressed for success bring their resumes and introduce themselves to representatives of companies that interest them.TBEIA is about helping Florida students kick-start their careers!"

I want to sit either in the mezzanine or balcony sections.  The cost for those tickets are $70-105.00 plus tax/fees (a ticket for $80 came with an $18 charge for fees, $105 ticket had $22).  Both are selling out fast so the event may be moved to Sunday June 16th instead.",

        "description": "\u2022 Endometriosis affects 10% of reproductive age women with an average age of seven years between symptoms development and making the diagnosis.\n\u2022 Endometriosis affects the quality of life of millions of women around the world. One of the most important causes of the delayed diagnosis is dismissal of symptoms by patients, their family members, or their treating physicians.\n\u2022 Raising community awareness is crucial to enhance the care of women suffering from this disease. Without community awareness, advocating for a woman with endometriosis to seek specialized care is almost impossible.\n\nJoin us at the historic Tampa Theater as we honor Endometriosis Awareness Month with an official screening of the film Below the Belt, a film about the inspiring stories of four patients advocating for themselves as they have been diagnosed with endometriosis. This event sponsored by the Women\u2019s Institute at Tampa General Hospital focuses on raising community awareness of the disease, its symptoms, the lifelong struggle for patients, and the possible treatment modalities to improve the quality of life of the patients.\n\nFor more information on this screening, call (813) 660-6101 or email\ncommunitylectures@tgh.org.\n\nEvent Location:\nTampa Theatre 711 N. Franklin Street, Tampa, FL 33602",

Being in Canada, I was a little unsure of your service but thought I would give it a try.  I cannot believe how incredible it was through the whole process.  From step one I received an e-mail telling me about my order.  Then again and again I received e-mails as my tickets were shipped and the dates and where they were along the way.  What a magnificent set up you have and I will definitely put you in my favourites as the BEST place to purchase tickets in the future.  Great service, great prices!!

A friend is looking for tickets for Van Halen at the Izod Center. They have your number... Thanks again.\" --Gina in Lanoka Harbor, NJ\n\n\"Thanks for the On-Line Ticket Exchange. I bought tickets to hear THE POLICE @ the Toyota Center on my daughter's 17th birthday! I scored major \"mom\" points with these tickets. Thanks Again!\" --Gail in Spring, TX\n\n\"I do not leave feedback often unless the service and/or product was exceptional.  Just wanted you to know that the 3 tickets for a St. Louis Blues NHL game I purchased from your site were unbelievable.  I knew they would be fairly decent seats when I ordered them.  But, having never been to Scottrade center I was blown away to be sitting 9 rows up off center ice for around $60/ticket.  We were so close, you could hear the words the players were yelling at one another. These were normally $127/ticket seats. The tickets arrived within 2 days of the order being placed, in mint condition, exactly as described.  I will definitely use this service again and recommend it to others.\" --Kathleen in Topeka, Kansas\n\nMy City Rocks! Does yours?\n",

Great seats! I would recommend to anyone looking for concert tickets at a great price!\" --Jillanna in Springville, UT\n\n\"I just wanted to say thanks for the great tickets, the show was a blast and it made a great birthday gift for my girlfriend.  Thank you for the great customer support and timely delivery of the tickets, everything went just great!\" --Matthew in New York, NY\n\n\"It was an absolute unique experience, I would definitely recommend MyCityRocks to friends and people from other cities.

I am totally telling my friends about your site and checking it in the future for sure.\nThanks sooo much!!!!!!!!!\" --McKenzie in Troy, NY\n\n\"I ordered tickets to [see an NHL game] while we are on vacation in Fort Lauderdale Florida in March.  Being in Canada, I was a little unsure of your service but thought I would give it a try.  I cannot believe how incredible it was through the whole process.  From step one I received an e-mail telling me about my order.  Then again and again I received e-mails as my tickets were shipped and the dates and where they were along the way.  What a magnificent set up you have and I will definitely put you in my favourites as the BEST place to purchase tickets in the future.  Great service, great prices!!  Thank you so very much I am thrilled with my tickets!\" --Sandra in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada\n\n\"Everything was great. Your service was great. The seats were great. Thanks for the parking pass and the tickets for drinks to the lounge. I am a satisfied customer and I will use you guys again when I need tickets to a show. I would highly recommend your company to people I know in other cities if your service was available. Thank you again.\" --Joe in Canton, OH\n\n\"Got my tickets from you at the last minute. Seats were great, customer service awesome. I passed your number around at a party the following night. Told everybody how great you were. A friend is looking for tickets for Van Halen at the Izod Center. They have your number... Thanks again.\" --Gina in Lanoka Harbor, NJ\n\n\"Thanks for the On-Line Ticket Exchange. I bought tickets to hear THE POLICE @ the Toyota Center on my daughter's 17th birthday! I scored major \"mom\" points with these tickets. Thanks Again!\" --Gail in Spring, TX\n\n\"I do not leave feedback often unless the service and/or product was exceptional.  Just wanted you to know that the 3 tickets for a St. Louis Blues NHL game I purchased from your site were unbelievable.  I knew they would be fairly decent seats when I ordered them.  But, having never been to Scottrade center I was blown away to be sitting 9 rows up off center ice for around $60/ticket.  We were so close, you could hear the words the players were yelling at one another. These were normally $127/ticket seats. The tickets arrived within 2 days of the order being placed, in mint condition, exactly as described.  I will definitely use this service again and recommend it to others.\" --Kathleen in Topeka, Kansas\n\nMy City Rocks! Does yours?\n",
